Things I wrote at school on my calculator

## NUMGUESS
* Similar to mastermind
* Calculator gives clues about if guessed digits are in the actual number and if they are in the right place
* Set number of digits

## EULERMTD
* Euler's method
### Running
put function in terms of X and Y into Y1, then run EULRMTD

## ENCODE and DECODE
* Pair of programs
* uses the [Vigenère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) cipher
  * Ceaser cipher with code word
* Performs Vigenère cipher and converts to base 3
### Running
1. Run encode with message and code word
2. Copy down the three strings of numbers
3. Run decode with the copied down code and the code word

## PH
* Calculates the pH of weak acids using the PKa and the molarity
* We were doing a lot of these problems in class it it was tedious to manually enter them into my calculator

## POLYRTHM
* Makes any polyrhythm
* Rhythms are shown on each side of the screen

## MATHGME
* Timed game where you solve as many math problems in a set amount of time as possible
* Types of math problems include
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Powers
  * Trignometry
  * Logic
* Runs are seeded so other people can play the same questions
* Program is written so that adding types of problems is easy
